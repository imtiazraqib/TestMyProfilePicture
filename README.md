## Why was Test My Profile Picture created?

The idea for Test My Profile Picture came when I was considering changing my Instagram profile picture. I realized I needed to test how my new image would look but didn't find any existing tools that could simulate the appearance on the platform. My previous profile picture was backed up in Google Photos, and I had to go through the hassle of finding and downloading it in case I wanted to revert. This challenge sparked the creation of Test My Profile Picture, to help not just myself but others facing the same dilemma.
