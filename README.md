# TestMyProfilePicture
A web app that showcases what your profile picture will look like on social media platforms as a preview.

## Why create this?
I was looking to change my instagram profile picture but I wanted to test to see what my new image looked like. My old picture was uploaded a long time ago and I had to go through my Google Photos backup, find the old image, download it incase I did not like my new one. I looked online for a solution and I could not find anything that would simulate what my picture would look like on before I change it and thus, TestMyProfilePicture was born.
